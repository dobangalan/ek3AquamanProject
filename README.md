# Project: On-Off Touch Sensor Switch Circuit
# Description: This project aims to design, create, analyze, and demonstrate a touch sensor circuit that can be used a replacement the traditional on - off switches using LEDs, a power supply, resistors, breadboards, wires, Timer IC .
# Features: The proposed circuit will employ an integrated circuit known as the 555 timer IC, which is capable of generating precise time delays and oscillations. It will be used to create a sensor that will activate once it is touched.
